# Online Chess

This project is a web application where you can play chess against other players or against an AI.

## Gameplay

To play, simply create a new game. If you want to play with a friend, share the game code with them so they can join your game.

If you want to play against the computer, you can select an engine to play against and create a game with the computer.

### AI Engines

The application features a custom-built AI using a hybrid model of minimax and machine learning. However, this AI is not very strong. For a more challenging game, you can choose to play against **Stockfish 14**, which has been integrated into the application.
